## Firebase setup (quickstart)

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. In your project settings, get the web app config values.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following (replace values):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

4. Install dependencies and start dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. Use the initialized exports in `src/lib/firebase.ts` â€” `auth`, `db`, and `storage` are exported for convenience.
